class VectorFieldEstimator(nn.Module):
    r"""Base class for vector field (e.g., score and ODE flow) estimators.

    The density estimator class is a wrapper around neural networks that
    allows to evaluate the `vector_field`, and provide the `loss` of $\theta,x$
    pairs. Here $\theta$ would be the `input` and $x$ would be the `condition`.

    Note:
        We assume that the input to the density estimator is a tensor of shape
        (batch_size, input_size), where input_size is the dimensionality of the input.
        The condition is a tensor of shape (batch_size, *condition_shape), where
        condition_shape is the shape of the condition tensor.
